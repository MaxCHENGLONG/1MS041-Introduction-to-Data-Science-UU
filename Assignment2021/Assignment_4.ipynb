The reason why $G(x) = e^x$ is two-fold, the first is that it always gives positive values no matter $x$, which fits the parameters space of the Poisson distribution, the second reason is that in practice it tends to be a better model for count data. Think of $X_i$ as denoting the presense or absence of something, then the rate-parameter $\\lambda(0) = e^{\\beta_0}$, and in the presense of $X_i = 1$ it becomes $\\lambda(1) = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1} = e^{\\beta_0}e^{\\beta_1} = \\lambda(0)e^{\\beta_1}$, thus it is multiplicative.
