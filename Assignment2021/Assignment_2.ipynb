    "We have seen how to implement a new iterator (just like a function) but with `yield` statement (just like `return` in a function). This model of computation is called **continuation**. This is very useful in combinatorics, especially when combined with recursion (*Computational Mathematics with SageMath, SIAM, 2019, p. 346*). Below is an iterator called `generateWords(alphabet,L)` that can generate all words of of a given length `L` on a given `alphabet`.\n",
